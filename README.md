# Snake Game Project BE
This repository contains the backend code for the project. It is built using Sequelize, Express, PostgreSQL, and follows the MVC software pattern.

## Introduction
The backend repository is responsible for handling the server-side logic and providing the necessary APIs to interact with the application's data stored in a PostgreSQL database. It uses Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library and Express as the web framework.

## Features
- Implements the MVC (Model-View-Controller) software pattern for better organization and separation of concerns.
- Provides a RESTful API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various resources.
- Utilizes Sequelize for database interactions, including defining models, associations, and executing queries.
- Handles data validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and provide meaningful error responses.
- Supports authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints.
- Follows best practices for code organization, error handling, and security.

## Installation
To install and set up the backend repository locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
- Navigate to the project directory: cd <project-directory>
- Install the dependencies: npm install
- Configuration
- The backend repository requires configuration for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.

Follow the steps below to configure the application:

- Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env.
- Open the .env file and modify the environment variables as per your setup.
- Provide the necessary values for variables like DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD to connect to your PostgreSQL database.

## Usage
To start the backend server, use the following command:

npm start
This command will start the server and make it available at the specified port (default is 4000).

## API Endpoints
